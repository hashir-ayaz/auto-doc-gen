# API Documentation Generator for GitHub Repositories

## Project Description

This project is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates API documentation from GitHub repositories. It aims to simplify the process of creating and maintaining up-to-date API documentation for developers.

## Key Features

- Analyzes GitHub repository contents to extract API information
- Generates comprehensive API documentation in various formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown)
- Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Integrates with GitHub workflows for automatic updates
- Utilizes AI to enhance documentation quality and completeness

## How It Works

1. The tool clones or accesses the specified GitHub repository
2. It scans the codebase to identify API endpoints, parameters, and responses
3. AI models process the extracted information to generate human-readable documentation
4. The generated documentation is formatted and can be hosted alongside the API or in a separate location

## Benefits

- Saves time and effort in manually writing and updating API documentation
- Ensures documentation stays in sync with the latest code changes
- Improves API usability and adoption by providing clear, up-to-date documentation
- Enhances collaboration between API developers and consumers

## Getting Started
